## Prerequisites

1.Visual studio code (IDE)
2.POSTMAN
3.Database - MySQL
4.Node.js

## Dependencies to be installed 

- npm i 
- start app by npm start


<h4>Important Commands to run the server and test</h4>

## Scripts
- `npm start`: starts the development server
- `jest test`: runs test suite

## Endpoints
The following endpoints are available for operations:

GET - http://localhost:3000/v1/user/{id}

POST - http://localhost:3000/v1/user

PUT - http://localhost:3000/v1/user/{id}

GET - http://localhost:3000/v1/user/{id}

GET - http://localhost:3000/v1/product/{id}

POST - http://localhost:3000/v1/product

PUT - http://localhost:3000/v1/product/{id}
